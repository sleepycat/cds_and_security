.quote[The Government of Canada has an opportunity—and a responsibility—to deliver world-class services to Canadians. <strong>This will require disruption as we make the switch, both technically and culturally, to agile digital delivery models.</strong> <strong>To accelerate these efforts, I am excited to announce the launch of the Canadian Digital Service (CDS)</strong> to modernize the way the Government of Canada designs and delivers digital services. CDS will be a partner to departments in delivering measurably improved services. <strong>We are rethinking the service design and delivery process</strong> from the user’s perspective, and engaging users every step of the way. -- the Honourable Scott Brison]

???
At the ministerial level there is an appetite to explore process changes to increase the number of projects that are successfully delivered.

# "To accelerate these efforts..."

## CDS partners to:

* Deliver solutions: design, prototype, build 
* Build Capacity: recruitment, learning
* Provide advice: support CIOB and others

## CDS doesn't:

* operate services (not a business owner)

### "rethinking the service design and delivery process"

* Agile/Iterative development
* User/Human-centered Design
* Devops
* Continuous Delivery

There is a common thread that runs through these...

What does rethinking the design and delivery process mean? All the buzzwords:

* Agile/Iterative development
* User/Human-centered Design
* Devops
* Continuous Delivery

But there is a common thread that runs through them...

## User/Human-centered Design

.quote[<strong>Evaluating designs with users</strong> and improving them based on their feedback <strong>provides an effective means of minimizing the risk</strong> of a system not meeting user or organizational needs -- ISO 9241-210:2010]

---

class: center, middle

## Agile/Iterative development

.quote[<strong>Iteration should be used to progressively eliminate uncertainty</strong> during the development of interactive systems. Iteration implies that descriptions, specifications and prototypes are revised and refined when new information is obtained <strong>in order to minimize the risk</strong> of the system under development failing to meet user requirements. -- ISO 9241-210:2010]

## Continuous Delivery

## Devops

.quote[<strong>Lowering risk of change</strong> with tools and culture -- John Allspaw]

???
Reducing risk by shortening feedback loops via automation and shared responsibility

# We want to deliver low risk systems

## CDS has a mandate to experiment

* We keep these experiments practical by building
* We turn our experiments into advice or working systems
* We share what we learn

.quote[It’s important that we embrace Cloud, while addressing cybersecurity concerns. As we embrace Cloud, we can address security issues and we can do so by balancing the importance of security with excellent digital services. -- the Honourable Scott Brison]

## The Cloud

.quote[An enabling technology is an invention or innovation, that can be applied to drive radical change in the capabilities of a user or culture. <strong>Enabling technologies are characterized by rapid development of subsequent derivative technologies, often in diverse fields</strong>. -- Wikipedia]

## Infrastructure as Code

---
class: center, middle

## When infrastructure is code

* Visibility into every aspect of a system
* Infrastructure changes can be tracked via version control
* No gap between documentation & reality
* Auditable on an ongoing basis
* IaC + open code is the foundation of security automation
* Automated security means more security & faster security
* Security efforts directed to improving providers: everyone benefits

## Infrastructure as Code: Linuxkit
